# Project-Riptide

Project riptide is the current undergoing development of a movement system for the 22999 NB GEARS team. A differential swerve drive system is one of the most sophisticated drive system in the FTC competition, using a differential gear meshing for both of the upper and lower gear ring to drive the wheel forward and backward while also act as a roll movement when the force is acting in the same direction.

We aimed to perfect the Riptide DSD system and create the most stable, affordable, dependable, and accessible system by using the rapid prototyping standard as our engineering principle. Remember, gracious professionalism.
